My research focuses on the numerous challenges of starting and growing innovative startups from a broad perspective. As an empirical researcher, I gather unique and large datasets and make use of sophisticated statistical methodologies to examine questions around crowdfunding, the financing and regulation of startups, and the economics of entrepreneurship.
